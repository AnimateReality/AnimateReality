I'm a software developer living in New Zealand.

I enjoy playing sports and actively participate in playing badminton as well as other hobbies such as table tennis, piano and juggling. In my downtime, I also like researching and getting involved with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. As a developer, I enjoy learning new things and try to make practical applications from the things that I learn.

I like to work with different technolgies and expand my skillset.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
